# DSD-elevator-simulation
this is the verilog code of final project for digital system design course.
in this project i simulate controller of an elevator.

# Tools
The following software were used to write this program
- Modelsim
- Visual Studio

# Language 
System Verilog

# Implementation Details
In this program, according to the logic required for an elevator in a five-story building, the required modules have been designed

# How to run
To run this program, a project must first be created in the Modelsim and then the designed files must be added to the project.
After that, by using Simulation Button and then start simulation and then selecting work folder, we select the module designed in the test, which can be seen in this section, to enter Simulation window.
